Created a unique method of crime data crawling from public news media sources versus standard police report data, and used natural language processing libraries to parse free texts, machine learning to classify types of crime along with statistical methods to produce "safest path" suggestion for pedestrians. We transformed news article data into coordinates and mapped onto Google Maps, and eventually created a safety-prevention Android mobile app.
